= knife-cloudstack

== DESCRIPTION:

This is the Edmunds Knife plugin for CloudStack. This plugin gives Knife the ability to create, bootstrap and manage
CloudStack instances.

== INSTALLATION:
This plugin is distributed as a Ruby Gem. To install it, run:

    gem install knife-cloudstack

Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to run this command with root privileges.

== CONFIGURATION:
In order to communicate with the CloudStack API you will have to tell Knife about your CloudStack API Key, your Secret Key and the URL of the API endpoint.
The easiest way to accomplish this is to create some entries in your <tt>knife.rb</tt> file:

    knife[:cloudstack_url] = "http://yourcloudstackserver.com:8080/client/api
    knife[:cloudstack_api_key]  = "Your CloudStack API Key"
    knife[:cloudstack_secret_key] = "Your CloudStack Secret Key"

If your knife.rb file will be checked into a SCM system (ie readable by others) you may want to read the values from environment variables:

    knife[:cloudstack_url] = "#{ENV['CLOUDSTACK_URL']}"
    knife[:cloudstack_api_key] = "#{ENV['CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY']}"
    knife[:cloudstack_secret_key] = "#{ENV['CLOUDSTACK_SECRET_KEY']}"

You also have the option of passing your CloudStack URL and API/Secret Keys into the individual knife subcommands using the <tt>-U</tt> (or <tt>--cloudstack-url</tt>),
<tt>-A</tt> (or <tt>--cloudstack-api-key </tt>) <tt>-K</tt> (or <tt>--cloudstack-secret-key</tt>) command options
    # provision a new small RHEL 5.6 webserver
    knife cs server create my-server -r 'role[webserver]' -S "small" -T "RHEL 5.6 Base" -A 'Your CloudStack API Key' -K "Your CloudStack Secret Key" --distro "rhel5-gems"

Additionally the following options may be set in your <tt>knife.rb</tt>:

* knife[:cloudstack_service]
* knife[:cloudstack_template]
* knife[:cloudstack_zone]
* knife[:distro]
* knife[:template_file]

== Public Clouds (Tata InstaCompute, Ninefold etc):
To get this plugin to work in public clouds, it is essential that the virtual network (and router) be allocated to the account. Cloudstack clouds automatically creates a virtual network  when the first VM is requested to be created. Hence, it is essential to create the first VM (of a newly created account) manually(which can be terminated immediately if not required) to ensure the virtual network is created.

== SUBCOMMANDS:

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands.  Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a <tt>--help</tt> flag

=== knife cs <command> list

<tt>--filter</tt>               Filters your output on the fields that you specify. Filter can be a string 'name' or regexp '/name/i'
    Example: knife cs server list --filter "instancename:/i-xxx/i, account:accname"

<tt>--fields</tt>               The fields that you want to display in your output. Default outputs will be shown if no fields are defined.
    Example: knife cs server list --fields "name, instancename, domain"

<tt>--fieldlist</tt>            This will display all information returned by the cloudstack API. These fields can be used within the <tt>--fields</tt> or <tt>--filter</tt> to create custom output.
The data displayed is based on first result returned in your output. You can get other result by using the <tt>--filter</tt> option.

<tt>--noheader</tt>             this will remove the column header from the output.


=== knife cs server create

Provisions a new server in CloudStack and then performs a Chef bootstrap (using the SSH protocol).  The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed on the target
system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server. The main assumption is a baseline OS installation exists (provided by the provisioning). It is primarily
intended for Chef Client systems that talk to a Chef server.  By default the server is bootstrapped using the 'chef-full' template (default bootstrap option for knife,
(Ref. http://docs.opscode.com/knife_bootstrap.html). This can be overridden using the <tt>-d</tt> or <tt>--template-file</tt> command options.
VM provided with <tt>--no-bootstrap</tt> option have no forwarded ports or forwared ip rules (in case <tt>--static-nat</tt> is used).

By default, new servers are allocated a public IP address mapping to the CloudStack private IP address. If you do not want this behavior, pass the <tt>--no-public-ip</tt> option.

==== Port forwarding rules for virtual networks
The <tt>--port-rules</tt> option takes a comma separated list of port forwarding rules. These rules are created on the
virtual public ip address of the server. Note that this option only applies to servers using a virtual network; it is
ignored if the server's public ip address is on a direct attached network.

Port forwarding rules have the syntax <tt>PUBLIC_PORT[:PRIVATE_PORT[:PROTOCOL]]</tt>. <tt>PRIVATE_PORT</tt> and
<tt>PROTOCOL</tt> are optional. The default value of <tt>PRIVATE_PORT</tt> is <tt>PUBLIC_PORT</tt> and the default
<tt>PROTOCOL</tt> is 'TCP'.
For example, a rule to forward from public port 80 to private port 7000 would look like <tt>80:7000:TCP</tt>.
Since 'TCP' is the default protocol, the rule can be shortened to <tt>80:7000</tt>. A rule can even be shortened to a
single number when the public and private ports are the same. For example, a rule to forward from public port 25 to
private port 25 can be stated as simply <tt>25</tt>. A list of such rules for a webserver might look like
<tt>80,443</tt>.

==== IP forwarding rules
The <tt>--ipfwd-rules</tt> option takes a comma separated list of ip forwarding rules. These rules are created on public ip appdress assigned obtained with <tt>--static-nat</tt> option.
(Ref. http://cloudstack.apache.org/docs/api/apidocs-4.0.0/root_admin/createIpForwardingRule.html)

Ip forwarding rules have the syntax <tt>START_PORT[:END_PORT[:PROTOCOL]]</tt>. <tt>END_PORT</tt> and <tt>PROTOCOL</tt> are optional.
The default value of <tt>END_PORT</tt> is <tt>START_PORT</tt> and the default <tt>PROTOCOL</tt> is 'TCP'.
For example, a rule to forward ports range from 1024 to 10000 would look like <tt>1024:10000:TCP</tt>.
Since 'TCP' is the default protocol, the rule can be shortened to <tt>1024:10000</tt>. A rule can even be shortened to a
single number when the start and end ports are the same. For example, a rule to forward port 22 can be stated as simply <tt>22</tt>. A list of such rules for a webserver might look like <tt>80,443</tt>.

==== Create Firewall Rule for given ip address
The <tt>-f, --fw-rules</tt> option takes a comma separated list of firewall rules which are applied to the public ip address assigned to the current server.

Firewall rules have the syntax <tt>PROTOCOL[:CIDR_LIST[:START_PORT[:END_PORT]]]</tt>. <tt>START_PORT</tt> and <tt>END_PORT</tt> must not be specified when <tt>PROTOCOL</tt> is <tt>ICMP</tt>, <tt>CIDR_LIST</tt> is always optional.
The default value of <tt>END_PORT</tt> is <tt>START_PORT</tt>, the default <tt>CIDR_LIST</tt> is '0.0.0.0/0'.
For example, a rule to open firewall for port 80 to everyone would look like <tt>TCP::80</tt> and a rule to open ICMP to internal network would look like <tt>ICMP:10.0.0.0/8</tt>.
